# Mean Girls Gallery
Mean Girls Gallery is an interactive and fun platform where users can choose the paintings they love and hate with the inspiration of Miss Regina George herself.

The goal was to create a single page application using React.js frontend. Backend was provided by Flatiron.

In development, I used Flexy Flip Cards to make the information for each painting flip.

# Concerns and Issues
- There is plenty of refactoring to be done in order to make cleaner and clearer code
